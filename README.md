## Coffee Delivery

The app features three screens: a presentation screen with a list of available coffees, a form with address information, and an order confirmation screen with delivery information. Users can navigate through the three pages to add fresh coffee orders to the cart, increment and decrement the quantity of each coffee type limited by the maximum amount of coffee in the inventory, and submit the form to see the order confirmation page with the order message.
